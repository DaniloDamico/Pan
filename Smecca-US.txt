1) As a housewife I want to be notified before the expiry date of a product added to my profile, so that I can consume it in time. 
 
2) As a user I want to be involved in events* to dispose the products I own, so that I can save my money buying just what I need. 
 
3) As an activist I want to create events* to encourage users to avoid waste, so that I can contribute to reduce environmental pollution.

*event: a functionality provided by the system to encourage users to consume products of their choosing with set specifications in a limited time frame. Only activists and brand managers can create events. The creator of the event specifies its duration and the specifications needed to partecipate in it.
